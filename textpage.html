            I returned to the area of my high school a few years after I graduated and found that every place I had written into my memory had disappeared; the Mike's Papaya, the too-expensive corner diner, the musty bookstore where I had kissed my first boyfriend. What they had been replaced by was not of note. This site is not an elegy nor a narrative of gentrification. It's a place to deposit memories, of what used to be.

            things don't die or remain damaged <br>
but return: stumps grow back hands, <br>
a head reconnects to a neck, <br>
a whole corpse rises blushing and newly elastic. <br>
Later this vision is not True: <br>
the grandmother remains dead <br>
not hibernating in a wolf's belly. <br>
Or the blue parakeet does not return <br>
from the little grave in the fern garden <br>
though one may wake in the morning <br>
thinking mother's call is the bird. <br>
Or maybe the bird is with grandmother <br>
inside light. Or grandmother was the bird <br>
and is now the dog <br>
gnawing on the chair leg. <br>
Where do the gone things go <br>
when the child is old enough <br>
to walk herself to school, <br>
her playmates already <br>
pumping so high the swing hiccups? <br>

        <p id="Paragon"><b>üèóÔ∏è The Paragon Building</b></id></p>
            <br><br>
            The Paragon Buildng in Long Island City makes most of its money today off the ads displayed on its roof, greeting those exiting the Midtown Tunnel or riders looking out the windows of the passing Long Island Railroad. Nearly a century before, in the middle of an LIC buzzing with the promise of the industrial revolution and the newly-built Queensboro Bridge, the building housed Paragon Oil, an oil distribution company founded in 1916 by the Schwartz brothers. The brothers, who were first generation Ukranian immigrants, designed and built the first oil heaters for residential buildings when most were still supplied by coal; later, they became oil distributors. The company closed big deals ‚Äî Paragon‚Äôs proximity to the New York docks and their five-gallon packaging made them the only American company to win a contract to supply fuel-starved Europe during post-war reconstruction. And during the Cpld War, they supplied the U.S. government with oil for submarines. 
        <br>
            <br>
        Paragon was eventually sold to Texaco in the late 1950s. The building also served intermittently as Queens‚Äô Borough Hall. All physical remnants of ht building will likely disappear soon‚ÄîRelated Companies bought it in 2016 and plans to turn it into a mixed-use space, with plans forretail spots and a beer hall. </p>

        üè¶ <b>Provident Loan Society</b>
        <br><br>
        <p>Lower East Siders have fought for years for the Provident Loan Society building to get landmark status. And they have lost every time. In 2015, their request was rejected once more, and its owners received approval to add 12 stories of luxury apartments atop the squat building. It'll be the building‚Äôs fourth iteration since it was opened during the 1893 financial panic, when banks were failing and foreclosures frequent. People were turning to loan sharks and pawn brokers, and getting ripped off. At the time, New York allowed these lenders to charge upto  48% interest annually.

            <br><br>

        And so, a group of self-proclaimed banker philanthropists including JP Morgan and Gustav Schwab got together to start the Provident Loan Society of New York, a not-for-profit lender inspired by Europe‚Äôs mont de piete (mount of piety).

        <br><br>
        
        They aimed to be ‚Äúdignified‚Äù lenders, the clean-cut art deco building meant to look more trustworthy than the seedy pawn shops of yore. Their model, once earning them 70 locations around New York, grew less popular as te economy stabilized and banks‚Äô coffers deepened, making the loan society‚Äôs interest rates not-so-low in comparison.

        <br><br>
        
        By the 1960s, famed painter and printmaker Jasper Johns, known for his crosshatch paintings, claimed the building as his studio. 
        
        Loft prices in Soho had started to shoot up and some artists thought Bowery could become the next Soho for artists -- but with no high-loft ceilings like in Soho,  this proved to be wrong.

        <br><br>
        
        In the 90s, the building became a series of different night clubs -- reviewers describe its last iteration Element, whose label can still be seen on the building, as ‚Äúsomewhat cramped.‚Äù

        Were the porn theaters romantic? Not at all. But because of the people who used them, they were humane and functional, fulfilling needs that most of our society does not yet know how to acknowledge.
